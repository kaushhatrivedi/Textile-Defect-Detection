# Textile-Defect-Detection
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Textile industry is one of the most thriving industries; but with the immense success ratio of this industry, there
are many other problems related to it - one of them being
the quality of the textile after every production step. There are
high possibilities of defects being caused due to machine defects,
faulty yarns, machine spoils and extreme stretching, etc. which
need to be looked for during the entire process. In this paper,
we look onto 5 different types of defects - colour defect, cuts,
holes, faulty threads, and metal contamination. Two different
methodologies have been used to understand and analyse these
defects through practical application by Fourier Analysis and
Mathematical Morphological methods which in turn determine
the quality of the textiles.
